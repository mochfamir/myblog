        <h1><strong>The Power of Saying "Thank You"</strong></h1>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>In a commencement addres delivered at his almamater, Dartmouth College, Fred Rodgers, the late producers and host of the ppopular childrern's TV program, <i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,</i> asked the crowd of newly minted graduates to try an extremely simple but remarkable exercise.</p>
            <p>In recognition of someone a teacher, a relative, a friend who had shaped their lives, he asked everyone assembled to take a minute to silently think about the person, and the impact they had on them:</p>
            <p>"Whereever they are, if they've loved you and encoureged you and wanted what was best in life for you, they're right inside yourself. And i feel that you deserve quiet time in this special occasion to devote some thought to them, so let's just take a minute in honor of those who have cared about us all along the way."</p>

            <p>It's moving scene, and i chalenge anyone wathing him say these words to notpause a moment and start reflecting on at least one person who has had a major influence on their life. (you can watch his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=907yEkALaAY">full speech on YouTube here</a>; the section about saying "thank you" starts right after the 10:00 mark).</p>
            <p>Cultivating a sense of inner gratitude can be inspiring and therapeutic. Expressing gratitude toward others can have a similiarly positive impact on the recipient, as anyone knows from the expressions of delight that an emailed or hand-written "thank you" can evoke.</p>
            <p>And now, abew study published by two US psychologist in the journal Psychological Science provides clinical proof of what many of us already knew: Saying "Thank You" can positively transform your relationship with others.</p>
            <p>In their research, as reported by the website of the British Psychological Society and The New Yoek Times, Amit Kumar at the Chicago Booth School of  Business asked participants to write an email to thank someone who had touched their life in a meaningful way and express what that person had done and how they had affected their life.</p>
            <p>They also asked participants to predict how the receipent would feel and perceive them. The researchers then made contact with the receipents to find out how they actually felt.</p>
            <p>One of the more surprising findings from their researchwas the gap in perceptions between the senders of the thank-you letters and the receipents. The senfers consistenly underestimated how positive the receipent felt about receiving the letters and how surprised they were by the content. The senders also overestimated how awkward the receipents would feel after receiving their notes. And they underestimated how warm, and esecially how competent, the receipents perceived them to be.</p>
            <p>But after receiving thank-you notes and filling out questionnaires about how it felt to get them, many receipents said they were "ecstatic," scoring the happines rating at 4 of 5. The senders typically guessed their note would elicit just a 3.</p>
            <p>Kumar and Epley's research also showed how doubt among the senders of thank-you letters affected their willingness to write such notes. Participants who questioned their own ability to craft a thank-skills, for example--were less willing to send one. And doubt around the perceived impact on receipents made senders less willing to write one.</p>

            <p><strong>What should you do?</strong></p>
            <p>Cast aside your doubts and go ahead and write that thank-you email (or card) you've been maining to send to that person who has helped you in some way, or has had a positive impact at a pivotal moment in your career or personal life.</p>
            <p>They'll probably appreciate it more than you can imagine.</p>
